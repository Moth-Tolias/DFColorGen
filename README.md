# DFColorGen
Features:
- Color picker - Using [jscolor](http://jscolor.com)
- Map Preview - Made using [izak1399](izaksmells.com/2012/06/dwarf-fortress-ttf-font-download)'s font, and a terribly formatted html table
- Creature Preview - Based on colour information from DF wiki
- Colour scheme presets - Also from the DF wiki
- Upload/Download of your own colorschemes - Using some client-side javascript


It's using some basic regex to extract the colour values, then using javascript to live update the colours on the page.
It should work in the latest Chrome/Firefox/Edge/IE, but I can't make any guarantees.
